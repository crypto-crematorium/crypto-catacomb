# CoinBurn (a.k.a. CryptoCrematorium)

## Introduction

Since the early days of its inception, bitcoin has been plagued by the accusation of being a ponzi scheme in which early users of the system are merely interested in being enriched by later adopters. **CRYPTO CREMATORIUM** seeks to dispel this misconception while helping to guide holders of bitcoin in their path to ensure that their economic power is appropriately gifted, or recycled through destruction after death. 

This page and the information within it does not seek to be seen or present any interested user as a member of a destructive cult. Rather, it should be used as an introduction and primer on a new financial paradigm which is both will intuitive and natural. Living within this emerging paradigm, such instruction may no longer be required to exist.

Because bitcoin is still so new, it is difficult to fathom where it has come from and where it will go. Here are a few tips for you and your loved ones when it comes to bitcoin and death:

* **Consider bitcoin and honest money:** Consider what bitcoin is and means to you. Educate yourself and others about bitcoin and honest money.
* **Think about life and death:** Nobody gets out of this alive. Sort yourself out.
* **Have a plan:** Plan for death with your loved ones through guided instruction and all of the existing legal tools at hand. Consider contingencies.
* **Study and practice intentional security:** Depending on your comfort level and desire for both security and self-directed monetary sovereignty, you may choose to do nothing at all above and beyond how you already hold bitcoin. This is an entirely appropriate course of action, but could potentially lead to unintended consequences such as theft or loss after death. Through the proper application of technology, you can ensure the safe transfer or destruction of your digital wealth.
